# The Future of Web Development

The web is constantly evolving. In 2026, we see a massive convergence between generative artificial intelligence and immersive interfaces.

## WebGL and 3D
It's not just for games anymore. User experiences now demand depth and dimension.

## AI on the Frontend
Components that adapt to user behavior in real-time.
